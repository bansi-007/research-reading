## 🎯 Your Learning Path

### **Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-3)**
**Goal**: Build solid understanding of Transformer architecture

1. **Week 1**: "Attention Is All You Need" - The foundational paper
2. **Week 2**: ResNet + LayerNorm - Essential building blocks  
3. **Week 3**: Integration and review

### **Phase 2-5**: Advanced Topics
Continue through pre-training, scaling, alignment, and efficiency techniques.

---

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Your Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test your environment
cd implementations/
python week1_attention_starter.py
```

### 2. Download Your First Paper
- Go to: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
- Download "Attention Is All You Need"
- Save it in the `papers/` folder

### 3. Start Reading (Week 1)
Follow this proven reading strategy:

**Day 1 (2 hours)**: First pass
- Read abstract, introduction, and conclusion
- Skim the methodology section
- Don't worry about understanding everything

**Day 2 (3 hours)**: Deep dive
- Read Section 3 (Model Architecture) carefully
- Focus on understanding self-attention
- Take notes using the template in `notes/note_template.md`

**Day 3 (2 hours)**: Implementation prep
- Study the multi-head attention equations
- Review the starter code in `implementations/week1_attention_starter.py`
- Plan your implementation approach

**Day 4-5 (4 hours)**: Implement
- Complete the TODO sections in the starter code
- Test each component individually
- Debug and refine your implementation

**Day 6 (1 hour)**: Review and document
- Fill out your study notes completely
- Update progress in `study_tracker.md`
- Reflect on what you learned

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### Start Simple, Build Complex
1. **Begin**: Implement scaled dot-product attention
2. **Progress**: Add multi-head mechanism
3. **Advance**: Build complete Transformer block
4. **Master**: Create full encoder/decoder

### Testing Approach
- Test each component with toy data
- Verify shapes and dimensions
- Compare with reference implementations
- Visualize attention patterns

## 📚 Study Tips for Success

### Reading Research Papers
- **Don't aim for 100% understanding**: First pass should be ~60%
- **Focus on intuition**: What problem does this solve?
- **Connect the dots**: How does this relate to previous papers?
- **Implementation first**: Code helps understanding

### Note-Taking Strategy
- Use the provided template consistently
- Focus on **why**, not just **what**
- Record your confusions and breakthroughs
- Make connections between papers

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Start small**: Work with tiny models first
- **Test everything**: Verify each component works
- **Debug systematically**: Use print statements liberally
- **Visualize results**: Plot attention weights, losses, etc.
