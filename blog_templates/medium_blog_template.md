## üíª Implementation Walkthrough

### Building It From Scratch
I implemented the paper's core ideas to truly understand them. Here's how:

#### Step 1: [First Component]
```python
class FirstComponent(nn.Module):
    """
    [Description of what this component does]
    """
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # Implementation details
        pass
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Step-by-step implementation
        return output
```

**Key Insights from Implementation**:
